# Duck_Lane_Detection
Development and experimentational of a neural network for the autonomous recognition of the roadway whit application to mobile robotics


This system was created starting from data recorded in the environment of Duckietown, a simulated city in which there are small mobile robots called duckiebots, which imitate a car that circulates on the streets of this city, and the CNN use in this work it is take by (Zou, Qin, et al. "Robust Lane detection from continuous driving scenes using deep neural networks." IEEE transactions on vehicular technology 69.1.

The main object of this work is to create a system can recognize a roadway using line detection using a CNN
